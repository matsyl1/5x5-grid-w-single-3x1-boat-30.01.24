5x5 grid with a single 3x1 boat. 
Using three adjacency functions and one same axis function to generate random coordinates that form a single 3x1 boat placed within the grid. 
No user interaction (building up to fully functional/playable game).
Output is a 5x5 grid with three coordinates "1, 2, 3" forming and showing the position of the boat.
